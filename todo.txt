The camera should not move and should only be used to add perspective (otherwise the circle radius might depend on the data).
Add SSAA multisampling
Add lines && rectangles
Circles location should be computed to fit in a [-1; 1] square region (same for rectanle for bar chart).
A renderer class should be created in order to render multiples plots on multiples surfaces
thus the data should not be bound to the plotter class but to the renderer class.
One rendering class per window ?
